# Regression using regularization and cross validation techniques

The lasso regression provides the subset of predictors that minimizes prediction error for a quantitive response variable. It is an analysis method that performs both variable selection and regularization to enhance prediction accuracy.   
Regression coefficient shrink towards zero due to imposed constraint on the model parameters.    
The benefits of using a lasso regression is that the interpretation of the model is simple with a reduced set of predictors.    
Problems can occur as the selection is limited to at most n variables before it is saturated.     
Also, Lasso does not allow for group selection, arbitrary selection of one variable can occur from a group when a group variable is taken into consideration.
